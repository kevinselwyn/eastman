## Explanation

The International Fixed Calendar is a revised calendar that consists of 13 months, each consisting of exactly 28 days, or 4 weeks, with individual standalone days for Leap Day and Year Day, Gregorian June 17 on Leap Years and Gregorian December 31 respectively.

Its most popular adoption is by the Eastman Kodak Company from 1928-1989 and was used for business and budgeting while employees still observed the Gregorian calendar.
